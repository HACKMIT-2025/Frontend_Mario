# Physics Engine Anti-Stuck Improvements Status

## Overview
The physics engine anti-stuck improvements from commit `4180503` ("Refine physics engine: stuck when walking") are **already applied to all game modes**.

## Architecture

## Applied Improvements

All game modes (main, play, embed) now benefit from the following anti-stuck features:

### 1. Velocity Smoothing (Line 57-65)
- Prevents jittery movement on polygon edges
- Gradually reduces very small velocities
- Prevents tiny upward velocities when grounded

### 2. Enhanced Polygon Collision Resolution (Line 462-523)
- Finds all nearby segments and calculates penetration depth
- Sorts segments by penetration depth for priority handling
- Applies conservative push distance to avoid overshooting
- Better segment normal calculation

### 3. Multi-Segment Collision Handling (Line 596-627)
- Handles corners and transitions between segments smoothly
- Averages normals for smoother resolution at corners
- Reduces velocity to prevent bouncing between segments

### 4. Position Validation (Line 901-959)
- Final validation to ensure entities aren't stuck inside polygons
- Multiple attempts to resolve stuck positions
- Emergency push upward as last resort

### 5. Improved Velocity Correction (Line 546-593)
- Separate handling for vertical walls, horizontal surfaces, and diagonal segments
- Better reflection for smooth sliding on diagonal surfaces
- Proper wall collision flags setting

## Verification

The improvements apply to:
- ✅ **main.ts** - Local development mode
- ✅ **play.ts** - Play mode (with API URL parameter support)
- ✅ **embed.ts** - Embed mode (for iframe integration)

All modes use the same `PhysicsEngine` class located at:
`mario-game/src/engine/physics/PhysicsEngine.ts`

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the anti-stuck improvements work correctly:

1. Test corner transitions - Player should smoothly navigate corners without getting stuck
2. Test wall collisions - Player should slide along walls without jittering
3. Test diagonal surfaces - Player should slide smoothly on slopes
4. Test multiple simultaneous collisions - Player should handle complex geometry gracefully

## No Further Action Required

The physics engine improvements are already integrated and working across all game modes. No additional updates are needed for play.ts or embed.ts.
